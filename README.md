# RiskBoardGame

This code simulates the dice roll battle mechanics of Risk

By inputing the population of both the attacking and defending states, the dice roll battles can be simulated either one battle at a time, until the attacking population drops to a certain level, or until either the defending army is defeated or the attack is repelled.

Battle reports including dice rolls, individual deaths, and population updates are shown for each battle

For multi-battle simulations, battle numbers and casualty counts are displayed
